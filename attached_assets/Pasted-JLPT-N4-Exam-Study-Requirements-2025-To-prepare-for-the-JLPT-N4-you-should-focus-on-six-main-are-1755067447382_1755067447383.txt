JLPT N4 Exam Study Requirements (2025)
To prepare for the JLPT N4, you should focus on six main areas: vocabulary, kanji, grammar, listening, reading, and general learning/study duration.

1. Vocabulary
You need to know about 1,500 words for JLPT N4. Most study lists are between 570–1,500 words, but aim for 1,500 to be safe.

2. Kanji
Approximately 250–300 kanji are required. This number includes kanji from both N5 and N4 levels. Some lists specifically mention 167–170 N4-level kanji, but combined with N5, the total is near 250–300.

3. Grammar
There are about 130–132 grammar points to master for N4. These cover basic grammar and intermediate patterns commonly found in everyday Japanese.

4. Listening
Practice understanding simple daily conversations, instructions, and short dialogs. Use JLPT N4 listening books such as Shinkanzen Master N4, Speed Master N4, and Nihongo Challenge N4–N5. Regular audio practice is essential for passing the listening section.

5. Reading
You need to read and comprehend straightforward passages, notices, and everyday texts. JLPT N4 practice books and free online tests target reading skills, including tests with questions about reasoning, grammar in context, and extracting main ideas from simple text.

6. Learning/Study Duration
Estimated study time: 550–1,000 hours (with prior N5 knowledge).

At a pace of 1 hour per day, this typically takes 1.5–2 years.

Intensive learners (2+ hours per day) may complete N4 in 8–12 months.
